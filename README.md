# AMATH352-ROV-Project
This project focuses on applying linear algebra methods and algorithms to simulate control systems from an Xbox controller for remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) with different settings. Project specifications and instructions were created by Doctor Thomas Grandine for AMATH 352: Applied Linear Algebra and Numerical Analysis in Spring 2025.
